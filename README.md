The data regard **density** of traffic and NOT actual traffic counts. They were acquired following the formula:

$D = \frac{dT_{A \rightarrow B}(t)}{dT_{A \rightarrow B,avg}}$


These can be mostly used for scaling known/approximated pollutant sources for pollutant dispersion studies. Example plot of the data can be sen below:\

* Av. Franklin Roosevelt

## Data sources
The included data have been acquired from the Google Maps API **(see TrafficData_Request.ipynb)** and include traffic densities for all possible combinations of points 1-7 **(see the map above)**. The were extracted for different weeks of the year (1-52), day of the week (1-7) and hour of the day (0-24) with a sampling rate of 30 minutes.

## Data formats and units

All acquired data have the following format/units:

|      **Quantity**      |                 **Format/Range**                |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| timestamp              | YYYY-MM-DD HHMMSS                               |

| wday                   | [1-7]                                           |
| hmin                   | [0-23.5]                                        |
